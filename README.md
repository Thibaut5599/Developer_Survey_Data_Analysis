# Developer Survey Data Analysis

This project was followed as part of the Coursera training [IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst?) during the ninth course entitled "IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project". This is a guided project.
This project was designed by Mr. Ramesh Sannareddy (Data Enginnering Subject Matter Expert at IBM) and Mr. Rav Ahuja (CCO & Global Program Director at IBM).

## Project Overview
This project explores global cinema trends by analyzing movies released between 1970 and 2024. The analysis focuses on three main areas: trends in movie ratings over time, genre popularity and evolution across decades, and global cinema diversity across genres and filmmakers.

## Objectives
- Trends in movie ratings over time
- Genre popularity and evolution by decade
- Global cinema diversity through genres and filmmakers

## Project Contents 
- **Dataset :** CSV file (m2_survey_data.csv).
- **Database :** SQLite file (m4_survey_data.sqlite). It's a SQLite database with 24 tables; 23 tables correspond to survey questions and contain response counts, while the "master" table includes the remaining data columns.

## Results and Conclusion
The visualizations and analysis indicate no strong correlations or clear trends within the dataset. A straightforward descriptive analysis, complemented by interactive visualizations in Tableau, provides a broad view for exploring movies released between 1970 and 2024.

## Usage 
- Data Analysis : Open Movies_1910_2024.ipynb to view the data cleaning, preprocessing steps and descriptive analysis using Python.
- Data Exploration : Open the dashboard (Analysis_MovieDataset.twbx) in Tableau or click [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/6CJJQQP8N?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to explore trends and patterns.
